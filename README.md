# Lava-Sponge
This datapack adds sponges that can clear lava.
# How to use
Cook up a `Sponge` in Furnace and it will give you a `Lava Sponge`, place the `Lava Sponge` near lava and it will clear 7x7x7 area and turn into `Heated Sponge` to convert the `Heated Sponge` back you need to place it next to a water source, this will turn it into a `Wet Sponge` and you can cook it in Furnace or place in Nether to get a `Sponge`.
# To-do list
1. Custom texture pack for this datapack.
2. Maybe use player heads for the Heated & Lava Sponges.
